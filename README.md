# Relationship Reflection App – Streamlit MVP

This is a Streamlit application that allows users to explore their relationship dynamics through guided exercises. Users select a topic, answer 5 reflective questions one at a time, and receive a summary at the end. All user responses are stored in **Firestore**, and users can rate how informative the exercise was.

---

## Features

1. **User Profile Input**

   * Users enter:

     * Name
     * Age
     * Gender
     * Relationship Status
   * This information is stored alongside their responses for personalized insights.

2. **Topic Selection**
   Users can select from various reflection topics, including:

   * “What really matters in conflict”
   * “How do you and your partner fight fair — or not?”
   * “What makes you feel most connected?”
   * “What do you wish your partner knew without having to say it?”
   * “How do stress and outside pressures show up in your relationship?”

3. **Guided 5-Question Flow**

   * Each topic has 5 sequential questions.
   * Users answer one at a time.
   * Responses are temporarily displayed for reflection.

4. **Summary and Insights**

   * After completing all 5 questions, the app generates a concise summary of the user’s responses.
   * Users are encouraged to reflect on patterns and insights revealed by the exercise.

5. **Feedback / Rating**

   * Users can rate how informative the exercise was on a scale (e.g., 1–5 stars).
   * Ratings and comments are stored in Firestore.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Backend / Database:** Firebase Firestore
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Storage:** Firestore collections for user profiles, responses, topics, and ratings

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/relationship-reflection-app.git
   cd relationship-reflection-app
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Firebase Firestore:

   * Create a Firebase project.
   * Enable Firestore in the console.
   * Generate a service account key JSON file.
   * Save it as `firebase_key.json` in the project root.

4. Configure Firestore in the app (example `config.py`):

   ```python
   import firebase_admin
   from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

   cred = credentials.Certificate("firebase_key.json")
   firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
   db = firestore.client()
   ```

---

## Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* Navigate through the onboarding steps (enter profile info).
* Select a reflection topic.
* Complete the 5-question flow.
* Review your summary and provide a rating for the exercise.

---

## Firestore Structure (Suggested)

* **users**

  * Document: user\_id

    * `name`
    * `age`
    * `gender`
    * `relationship_status`

* **responses**

  * Document: response\_id

    * `user_id`
    * `topic`
    * `question_1` … `question_5`
    * `summary`

* **ratings**

  * Document: rating\_id

    * `user_id`
    * `topic`
    * `rating` (1–5)
    * `feedback` (optional)

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add **user authentication** to track repeated sessions.
* Include **AI-generated summaries** tailored to responses.
* Implement **visual insights**, such as charts for recurring patterns.
* Enable **sharing of summaries** privately with partners.

If you want, I can also **draft a basic `app.py` skeleton** that implements this flow in Streamlit with Firestore integration, ready to plug in the 5-question content for each topic. Do you want me to do that next?
